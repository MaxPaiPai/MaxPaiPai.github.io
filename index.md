I am a senior undergraduate student major in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science. I also have a background in pure mathematics, computer science, and physics. 

My research interests are computational mathematics, numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Specifically, I am passionate about high order, structure preserving numerical schemes for various physical systems. Currently I am working on implementing discontinuous Galerkin method with an application to hazardous events. I'm also interested in utilizing numerical modeling as a tool for other problems, for example understanding the behavior of systems and PDE-constrained optimization. Moreover, given the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I’m actively seeking the interplay between this field and numerical methods. Specifically, I’m proposing deep learning for computer vision in collaboration with traditional numerical simulations for geophysical events.
