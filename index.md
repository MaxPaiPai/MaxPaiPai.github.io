I am a senior undergraduate student major in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University in the City of New York. I also have a background in pure mathematics, computer science, and physics. 

My research interests are computational mathematics, numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Specifically, I am passionate about high order, structure preserving numerical schemes for various physical systems. Currently I am interested in discontinuous Galerkin method with an application to hazardous events.
