## Basketball:

I am a basketball lover who strangely does not have a favorite team :) 

If I am not in front of my computer doing math or writing code, the best place to find me will probably be the basketball court.

## Nature Lover:

I also love all kinds of outdoor activities. Somtimes the view and the fresh air is even more exciting than activities themselves. 

Fun fact: My home was 30 seconds' walk from the sea, so I have a particular obsession for the sea.

## Bartending:

This is the cloest I can get to be a great chemist. (Just kidding. My pina colada actually tastes good)
